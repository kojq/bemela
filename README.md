## Usage

The `compile.sh` file compiles each algorithm file from every language folder into their respective binaries.
```ShellSession
./compile.sh
```

The `time.sh` file times each binary (with preset example inputs) and aggregates the results into a readable format.
```ShellSession
./time.sh
```

The `measure.sh` file measures the size of each binary and aggregates the results into a readable format.
```ShellSession
./measure.sh
```

## Features

- Standard set of algorithm implementations per language
- Each algorithm tests a certain language attribute

## Build

Modify the Bash scripts as needed.

Install each language you want to test onto your development environment.

Run the Bash scripts.
